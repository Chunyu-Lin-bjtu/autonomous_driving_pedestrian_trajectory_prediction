# Autonomous Driving Human Trajectory Prediction
human and vehicle trajectory prediction in dynmaic scenes

This is a pilot project, we train models to learn predicting human's future trajectories from its past trajectories. Our self-created datasets (default 6000 sets of map and trajectory) simulate human walking in the cross-road traffic condition.
