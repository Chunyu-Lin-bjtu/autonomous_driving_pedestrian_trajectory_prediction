# Autonomous Driving Human Trajectory Prediction
human and vehicle trajectory prediction in dynmaic scenes

This is a pilot project, our purpose is to train models to predict human trajectories given the past trajectory. The results of this project is intended to used in developing autonomous driving. Our self-created datasets (default 6000 sets of map and trajectory) simulated human walking in cross-road traffic conditions, such as human crossing road through the zebra lanes. Train context_gen script to generate context and trajectory by yourself.
