# Autonomous Driving Human Trajectory Prediction
human and vehicle trajectory prediction in dynmaic scenes

This is a pilot project, our purpose is to train models to learn predicting human trajectories according to its past trajectories. The results of this project is intended to used in the development of autonomous driving in industry. Our self-created datasets (default 6000 sets of map and trajectory) simulate human walking path in the cross-road traffic condition.
